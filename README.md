Task
-Build a model that can predict if the asteroid is going to be hazardous or not.

-To find the features which contribute the most in our prediction.

Method used in Predicting
XGBoost Classifier using randomized search

Conclusion
XGBoost classifier predicts the most accurate ( 99.92 %)

By observing Graph we can conclude the importance and contribution of that particular feature in the prediction of our model.
